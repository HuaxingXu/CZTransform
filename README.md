* CZTs order - O(log(n^n))

* how to



    cd {projectname}/prj/
    make run


* make command
  * make --------- [make build]
  * make build --- create directory(obj and bin) and compile this project
  * make clean --- remove binary and object file(directory)
  * make clear --- [make clean]
  * make delete -- [make delete]
  * make rebuild - [make clean and make build]
  * make run ----- [make build] and execute binary file
  * make test ---- [make run and make clean]
